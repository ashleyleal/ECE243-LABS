/* Program to Count the number of 1â€™s in a 32-bit word,
located at InputWord */
# used Lecture 7: Bitwise operations shift

/*
Idea:
- Shift bits as many times as the number of bits (32b)
- Each iteration check if LSB is 1
	- If it is, increment counter and continue
	- Otherwise continue with next iteration
